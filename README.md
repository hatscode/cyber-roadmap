I've converted the roadmap to focus on Red Team operations. Here are the key differences:

**What Changed:**

1. **Lab-focused**: Heavy emphasis on building Active Directory lab (you can't learn red teaming without AD)
2. **Active Directory attacks**: Kerberoasting, DCSync, Golden Tickets - core red team skills
3. **Post-exploitation**: Privilege escalation, lateral movement, persistence mechanisms
4. **Evasion techniques**: AV/EDR bypass, AMSI bypass, living off the land
5. **Physical security**: WiFi attacks, RFID cloning, social engineering
6. **C2 frameworks**: Command & Control infrastructure (Sliver/Cobalt Strike)

**Critical Notes:**

- **This is MUCH harder** than bug bounty hunting - requires deep Windows/Linux internals knowledge
- **You MUST build the AD lab** (Week 1) - this is non-negotiable for red team training
- **Practice ONLY in your lab** - red team techniques are illegal outside authorized engagements
- **Tool complexity**: Tools like Mimikatz, BloodHound, and C2 frameworks have steep learning curves
- **4 hours/day is tight** - some days (like AD lab setup) may need 6+ hours

**After 10 weeks, you'll be:**
- Junior red team level (entry-level)
- Ready to pursue **OSCP** or **CRTP** certification
- Capable of basic internal penetration tests
- Still need 6-12 months of practice for professional red team work

This is a challenging path - much more technical than bug bounty. Ready to commit?
